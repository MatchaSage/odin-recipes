    <h3>Description: </h3>
    <p>The recipe for this amazing chicken taco is as follows. Go to your nearest <strong>NewYork</strong> city dumpster(prefer one outside of a local chinese restraunt) and pick the most greasy piece of chiken you can from the trashbag thats over 3 days old. Next youll want to walk into TacoBell and ask for any left over dough that you can use as well as do some more fishing in the garbage can for some slightly used hotsauce packets(use mild, just trust me). Youre going to take that dough and "bake" it on the flattest blacktop you can find (probably a government run building). </p>
    <div class="blacktop"><img src="https://www.williespaving.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/resurface-in-camp-hill.jpg" alt="a lovely cooking surface" />
    </div>
    <p>Now youre on to to assembly part, youre going to take your half baked tortilla and place your chicken thats 40% covered in mold onto it, youre going to take the mildpackets and <strong>GENTLY</strong> <em>squirt just the right amount onto the chicken</em>, lastly youll fish the dried jalapeno slices out of your pocket and add them ontop of the masterpiece you have just created. All thats left is to give it a taste! I promise you wont be dissapointed by this one!</p>
